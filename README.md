A modern Android app for managing a [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) instance remotely
over its Web API — control your self-hosted server from your phone. Written in Kotlin.

## Features
- Free, open source, and respects your privacy — no ads, no tracking, no account
- Live torrent list with real-time speeds, progress, and ETA — sort, search, and filter by
  status, category, tag, or tracker
- Add via magnet links or `.torrent` files — straight from your browser or file manager — with
  per-file selection before you commit
- Full remote control: pause, resume, delete, recheck, and set queue priority or share limits,
  right from your phone
- Detailed per-torrent view with a browsable file tree, trackers, and live peer info
- Manage multiple servers, with encrypted backup/restore of your whole setup
- Light, Dark, or System theme, plus optional Material You dynamic colours
- Per-app language override, independent of your device's system language, with community
  translations via Weblate
- Smart notifications that jump straight to a finished download, with battery-friendly refresh
  rates you control
- Browse RSS feeds and articles, with auto-download rules and notifications for new matches
- Works with qBittorrent 4.x and 5.x over HTTP or HTTPS (including self-signed certs), with
  optional HTTP Basic Auth for servers behind a reverse proxy

See the [F-Droid listing](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.acamol.qbit/) for the full feature list.

> **Self-signed HTTPS:** certificates are validated properly (no blanket "trust everything"
> option, and nothing to install on your device). The first time you connect to a server whose
> certificate isn't signed by a trusted authority, you'll be shown its fingerprint and asked to
> approve it — once approved, that certificate is trusted for that server only. Review or clear
> the pinned certificate later from that server's settings. Plain HTTP on a LAN and
> normally-signed HTTPS work without any setup.
>
> **Upgrading from an older version:** if you previously trusted a self-signed server by
> installing its certificate on your device (Settings → Security → Install a certificate), you'll
> need to approve it once more in-app after this update — the app no longer trusts
> device-installed certificates for HTTPS, only certificates you've explicitly approved per
> server.

## Roadmap
- **Alternate speed-limit scheduler** — choose the time window and days when the alternate limits automatically take over
- **Quiet hours for notifications** — set the times when notifications stay silent, so a torrent finishing or an RSS article arriving at 2am doesn't wake you
